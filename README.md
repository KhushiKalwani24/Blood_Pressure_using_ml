🩺 Blood Pressure Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

High blood pressure (Hypertension) is one of the leading causes of heart diseases and strokes worldwide. Early prediction and monitoring can significantly reduce health risks.

This project leverages Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have high blood pressure based on medical and physiological parameters.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — using Python and popular data science libraries.
